# SoPra Group 7 - SpeetUp

Our application allows users to set up and join sports activities spontaneously. Users are shown the upcoming sports activities and can create or join a lobby, in which they decide with other users in real-time (1) what sport to play, (2) when to play it, and (3) where to play it. This facilitates the decision making process and promotes the idea of doing sports with your friends or new people from your area in a fun and collaborative way.
