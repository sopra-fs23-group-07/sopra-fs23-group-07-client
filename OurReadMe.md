# SoPra Group 7 - SpeetUp

If you have ever tried to organize a sports event with friends then you know how difficult and frustrating it can be to get a group of even 5 people to come to an agreenment. The greatest difficulty arises from trying to keep track of everyones preferences regarding what sport to play, when to play and where to play. It is simply impossible to organize an event with which everyone is happy with. This is precisely the problem SpeetUp was designed to solve, so next time you need to organize an event don't open WhatsApp, instead head over to SpeetUp. SpeetUp allows it's users to create lobbies where every member can express which sports they would like to play as well as where and when they can play. After all members of the lobby have locked their choices or if the timer has run out an event will be created using the majority option in each category. This way an event can be created with which everyone is satisfied by.

## Launch & Deployment

For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
