# SoPra Group 7 - SpeetUp

Our application allows users to set up and join sports activities spontaneously. Users are shown the upcoming sports activities and can create or join a lobby, in which they decide with other users in real-time (1) what sport to play, (2) when to play it, and (3) where to play it. This facilitates the decision making process and promotes the idea of doing sports with your friends or new people from your area in a fun and collaborative way.

## Launch & Deployment

For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
